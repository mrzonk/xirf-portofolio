I've been meaning to start a blog for a while now. I've always enjoyed writing, and I've been eager to share my thoughts and experiences with the world. However, I've been held back by the complexity of setting up a blog. I wanted something simple, fast, and easy to maintain. I didn't want to deal with databases, server-side rendering, or complex build processes. I wanted to focus on writing and sharing my thoughts without worrying about the technical details.

## Discovering JAMStack

Enter JAMStack, a modern web development architecture. When I stumbled upon it, I thought it might be the perfect fit for my needs. The beauty of JAMStack is the array of free hosting and platforms available, such as <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank">Vercel</a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>, and <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Cloudflare Pages</a>. After considering my options, I opted for <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank">Vercel</a> due to its user-friendly interface and free personal use option.

For the static site generator, I chose <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a>. Its framework-agnostic approach and familiar HTML-like coding environment won me over. Although I experimented with <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">NextJS</a> and <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/" target="_blank">NuxtJS</a>, I found Astro's lightweight nature and optimal performance more suitable for a simple blog.

## Simplifying CSS with UnoCSS

CSS can be challenging, not just in terms of syntax but also when dealing with bundling and maintaining a modular and reusable codebase. Various CSS frameworks like <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">TailwindCSS</a>, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, and <a href="https://bulma.io/" target="_blank">Bulma</a> aim to ease this pain, but choosing the right one can be a headache.

That's when I stumbled upon <a href="https://unocss.dev/" target="_blank">UnoCSS</a>, a CSS engine rather than a framework. It proved to be powerful and enjoyable, especially when combined with its Uno Preset, akin to <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind</a> and <a href="https://windicss.org/" target="_blank">WindiCSS</a>. The syntax is familiar, as shown below:

```html
<div class=" bg-#272d44 text-white p-4 rounded-lg text-20px">
  Hello World
</div>
```

This UnoCSS snippet compiles to the following CSS, handling custom properties like `bg-#272d44` and `text-20px` with ease:

```css
.bg-\#272d44 {
  --un-bg-opacity: 1;
  background-color: rgb(39 45 68 / var(--un-bg-opacity));
}
.text-20px {
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

UnoCSS's engine capabilities make it a standout choice, providing both power and simplicity. The best part? It's lightning-fast and remarkably easy to use. Oh! did i mention that unocss support a lot of preset from icon, atributify, transformers, and extractor.

## Wrapping Up

That's all for now. I'm excited about the future possibilities with this tech stack and can't wait to share more in the coming days. Stay tuned!
